 Hello Mrs. Moore, this is our description. We want to be able to play a functional game of soccer with multiple remote control cars for entertainment. We will make multiple functional cars which can play against each other in a game of soccer with a scoreboard. It will include interactive and kinetic features. We will make a soccer field, sensors, scoreboard, cars, and boost pads. Our limits are that we will need each thing to be the right size compared to everything in the game. It needs to function properly.
